# Quiz-App
This project is a full-stack online assessment platform where users can take timed quizzes, view their scores, and check a leaderboard displaying top performers.  The system dynamically fetches questions from an external API, manages a countdown timer with auto-submit functionality, stores results in a database, and displays rankings in real time.
